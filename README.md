# The Video Game Reviews project
## Created by Matthew Gibbs and Arsenio Colon

This project is a collaboration between the authors to create a website for 
video game reviews.

It will use the MetaCritic and Steam API's to pull useful data to users, who
can create reviews and share them with friends.  They can 'follow' other users
who have similar interests.
